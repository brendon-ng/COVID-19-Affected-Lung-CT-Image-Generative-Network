# COVID-19-Affected Lung CT Generative Network

## A Generational Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate CT scans of lungs with COVID-19

*A project for UCLA's CS 168 class taught by Professor Scalzo*

### Premise and Motivation
- Generate images of lungs with COVID-19 to model progression of COVID-19
- Use this to expand current datasets, which are limited in quantity
- Eventually create an image-to-image model to see the progression of the disease in one set of lungs

### Major Components
- Models (final and iterations -- .ipynb files)
- Data (from https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT)
- Latent Space Widget for visualization
- Generated images from the GAN
